# TG-bot-for-selection-of-steel-analogues
Project of graduation paper for bachelor degree in MUCTR.
Tg bot for the selection of steel analogues, which I made as part of my graduation paper for the bachelor's level. 
The bot is used to search for analogues of steel markings of the AISI system and Russian markings.
At the moment, the bot is not functioning, no further development of the project is planned.
This was one of my first programming experiences. A more complete database of analogues is required, and the relevance of such a chatbot is not clear at the moment. 
In any case, it was a wonderful experience :)
